# Bot Racer

## Constitutional Development

This project employs a unique development methodology called "Constitutional Development". This approach establishes a formal constitution that governs the development and behavior of the bot-racer system.

### What is Constitutional Development?

Constitutional Development is a structured approach where:

1. All code changes and system behaviors must comply with a written constitution
2. The constitution is maintained in `/docs/constitution/`
3. AI assistants and developers must verify compliance with the constitution before making changes
4. Changes that would violate the constitution are not permitted

### Amendment Process

The constitution can be modified through a formal amendment process:

1. Amendments can introduce new sections/subsections or revise existing ones
2. When a section is amended, the previous version becomes invalid
3. A current, consolidated version of the constitution is maintained at `/docs/constitution/constitution.md`
4. The original constitution is preserved for historical reference

### Purpose

This approach ensures:

- Consistent system behavior
- Clear governance of AI development
- Traceable evolution of system rules
- Protected core principles
- Controlled modification of fundamental rules

## Project Status

This project is under active development. The initial constitution has been established and serves as the foundation for all future development.
