# Bot Racer Constitution

*Established: February 28, 2025*

## Preamble

This constitution establishes the fundamental principles and rules governing the Bot Racer project. It serves as the supreme authority for all code decisions and system behaviors of software contained in this repository.

## Article I: Constitutional Framework

### Section 1: Authority
1.1 This constitution is the highest authority governing the Bot Racer project.
1.2 All code, algorithms, and system behaviors must comply with this constitution.
1.3 AI assistants and developers are bound by these provisions.
1.4 No significance shall be attached to the ordering of Articles, Sections, or Subsections. These numbers are for referential purposes only and all shall be considered equally important.

### Section 2: Amendment Process
2.1 Amendments may be made to add or revise sections and subsections.
2.2 When a section is amended, the previous version becomes invalid.
2.3 The original constitutional document and all amendments must be maintained at `/docs/constitution/history/`.
2.4 the original constitution shall be named `000-original.md`.
2.5 all other amendments shall be named `XXX-amendment-name.md` where `XXX` is the sequential number of the amendment.
2.6 The current, consolidated constitution must be maintained at `/docs/constitution/constitution.md`.
2.7 the current constitution shall must be updated on each amendment to accurately reflect the new amendment.
2.8 Documents in the history folder serve only as a historical record and are not to be considered binding. Only the current constitution referenced in subsection 2.6 is to be considered binding.

### Section 3: Interpretation
3.1 AI assistants must interpret this constitution literally.
3.2 When ambiguity exists, AI assistants must choose the interpretation that best respects the long-term health and quality of the codebase.
3.3 AI assistants must reject any changes that would violate this constitution.

## Article II: Bot Racer Core Principles

### Section 1: Game Environment
1.1 Bot Racer shall be a racing game where programmed bots compete on defined tracks.
1.2 The game environment shall be deterministic given the same inputs.
1.3 The game state must be reproducible for any given set of inputs.

### Section 2: Bot Behavior
2.1 Bots must operate autonomously once a race begins.
2.2 Bots must not have access to information that would not be available to a human racer.
2.3 Bot decision-making must occur in real-time during the race.

### Section 3: Fair Play
3.1 All bots must have equal access to system resources.
3.2 No bot may interfere with the execution of another bot's code.
3.3 The racing environment must treat all bots impartially.

## Article III: Technical Requirements

### Section 1: Performance
1.1 The game must maintain a minimum frame rate of 30 FPS.
1.2 Bot computation must complete within each frame's time budget.
1.3 System resource usage must be monitored and constrained.

### Section 2: Safety
2.1 The system must validate all bot code before execution.
2.2 Bots must be sandboxed to prevent system interference.
2.3 Resource limits must be enforced for all bots.

### Section 3: Extensibility
3.1 The system must support the addition of new track layouts.
3.2 Bot APIs must be versioned and backward compatible.
3.3 The system must support future expansion of race mechanics.

## Article IV: Development Standards

### Section 1: Code Quality
1.1 All code must be documented with clear comments that accurately describe the code's purpose and current functionality.
1.2 Functions must have clear single responsibilities documented in comments.
1.3 Code must follow established project style guidelines.

### Section 2: Testing
2.1 All core functionality must have automated tests.
2.2 Changes must not break existing tests.
2.3 New features must include corresponding tests.

### Section 3: Version Control
3.1 All changes must be tracked in version control.
3.2 Commits must reference relevant constitutional provisions.
3.3 Breaking changes must be clearly marked.
