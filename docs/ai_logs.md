# AI Operations Log

## 2025-02-28 01:28:54 -0600 - Initial Project Setup
- Established constitutional development framework
- Created initial README.md with explanation of constitutional development
- Created initial constitution in `/docs/constitution/original.md`
- Created current constitution copy in `/docs/constitution/current.md`
- Set up AI operations log

### Files Created:
- `/README.md`
- `/docs/constitution/history/000-original.md`
- `/docs/constitution/constitution.md`
- `/docs/ai_logs.md`

### Notes:
Initial setup completed successfully. The constitution has been structured with four main articles covering Constitutional Framework, Bot Racer Core Principles, Technical Requirements, and Development Standards. Each article contains specific sections and subsections that will govern the development of the Bot Racer project.

## 2025-03-02 01:18:00 -0600 - Project Structure Setup
- Created initial Go project structure with shared packages
- Set up basic scaffolding for terminal app and server

### Files Created:
- `/go.mod`: Go module definition
- `/internal/track/track.go`: Track generation package
- `/internal/game/game.go`: Core game mechanics
- `/cmd/terminal/main.go`: Terminal client entry point
- `/cmd/server/main.go`: Server entry point

### Notes:
Created basic project structure following standard Go project layout. The `internal` packages will be shared between the terminal client and server, while keeping implementation details private. The `cmd` directory contains the main applications. Next steps will involve implementing the track generation algorithm and terminal UI.
